Strng and factors
================

## Strings and regex

``` r
string_vec = c("my", "name", "is", "jeff")

str_detect(string_vec, "jeff")
```

    ## [1] FALSE FALSE FALSE  TRUE

For exact matches, you can designate matches at the beginning or end of
a line

``` r
string_vec = c(
  "i think we all rule for participating",
  "i think i have been caught",
  "i think this will be quite fun actually",
  "it will be fun, i think"
  )

str_detect(string_vec, "^i think") #^ denotes that you want to search for something that starts with i think
```

    ## [1]  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE FALSE

``` r
str_detect(string_vec, "i think$") #$denotes that you want to search for something that ends with i think
```

    ## [1] FALSE FALSE FALSE  TRUE

``` r
string_vec = c(
  "Y'all remember Pres. HW Bush?",
  "I saw a green bush",
  "BBQ and Bushwalking at Molonglo Gorge",
  "BUSH -- LIVE IN CONCERT!!"
  )

str_detect(string_vec,"[Bb]ush")
```

    ## [1]  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE FALSE

``` r
string_vec = c(
  '7th inning stretch',
  '1st half soon to begin. Texas won the toss.',
  'she is 5 feet 4 inches tall',
  '3AM - cant sleep :('
  )

str_detect(string_vec, "^[0-9][a-zA-Z]")
```

    ## [1]  TRUE  TRUE FALSE  TRUE

The character . matches anything.

``` r
string_vec = c(
  'Its 7:11 in the evening',
  'want to go to 7-11?',
  'my flight is AA711',
  'NetBios: scanning ip 203.167.114.66'
  )

str_detect(string_vec, "7.11") # need to put \\ to search character to find something with a . "7\\.11"
```

    ## [1]  TRUE  TRUE FALSE  TRUE

``` r
string_vec = c(
  'The CI is [2, 5]',
  ':-]',
  ':-[',
  'I found the answer on pages [6-7]'
  )

str_detect(string_vec, "\\[")
```

    ## [1]  TRUE FALSE  TRUE  TRUE

## Factors

``` r
factor_vec = factor(c("male","male","female","female"))

factor_vec
```

    ## [1] male   male   female female
    ## Levels: female male

``` r
as.numeric(factor_vec)
```

    ## [1] 2 2 1 1

what happens if i relevel….

``` r
factor_vec = fct_relevel(factor_vec, "male")

as.numeric(factor_vec)
```

    ## [1] 1 1 2 2

## NSDUH– strings

``` r
nsduh_url = "http://samhda.s3-us-gov-west-1.amazonaws.com/s3fs-public/field-uploads/2k15StateFiles/NSDUHsaeShortTermCHG2015.htm"


table_marj = 
  read_html(nsduh_url) %>% 
  html_nodes(css = "table") %>% 
  first() %>%
  html_table() %>%
  slice(-1) %>%
  as_tibble()
```

``` r
data_marj =
  table_marj %>%
  select(-contains("P Value")) %>%
  pivot_longer(
    -State, #Chooses everything except state column
    names_to = "age_year",
    values_to = "percent"
  ) %>%
  separate(age_year, into = c("age","year"), sep = "\\(", ) %>%
  mutate(
    year = str_replace(year,"\\)",""),
    percent = str_replace(percent, "[a-c]$",""), #specifying what to remove
    percent = as.numeric(percent)
  ) %>%
  filter(!(State %in% c("Total U.S.","Northeast","Midwest","South","West")))
```

## NSDUH – factors

``` r
data_marj %>%
  filter(age == "12-17") %>%
  mutate(State = fct_reorder(State,percent)) %>% #change state to factor, then reorder by percent
  ggplot(aes(State, y = percent, color = year)) +
  geom_point() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.5, hjust=1))
```
